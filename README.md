TerrainGenerator
================

Unity3D terrain generation

We will use a diamond-square way of generating terrain

There are two parameters, which regulates terrain: GRAIN regulates roughness, R regulates rockiness
  
For example if GRAIN = 8 and R = 0.01 it will be a desert
  and if GRAIN = 16 and R = 0.1 it will be a mountain
  
You can easily change the script and achieve the best realism

Good luck!!
